    "# MQTT - using `paho` Package\n",
    "\n",
    "MQTT and MQTT-SN are IP protocols used to manage devices in the Internet of Things.  These protocols implement a publish and subscribe communication protocol between *clients*.  The publish and subscribe communication is managed by *brokers*.  One of the key ideas of MQTT and MQTT-SN is that brokers are relatively robust and available, while clients are often transient (for instance they might often sleep to save power).  Typically a client will publish *events* to a broker.  Each event consists of a *topic* and a *message*.   Typically the broker will relay each event to other clients who have subscribed to the same topic, although brokers may also communicate directly to relay events.  The main difference between MQTT and MQTT-SN is that MQTT is based on TCP, while MQTT-SN is based on UDP.  For more information, see http://mqtt.org/documentation.\n",
